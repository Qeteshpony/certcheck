# How to use

Just copy the script to your machine, make sure the requirements are met and make it executable. 

You can then either call it directly with `certcheck <domain>` or create symlinks with just the domain name as the name
linking to the script in `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local` to create a service for checkmk
